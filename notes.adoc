Hi SMEs,

I notice that oc export --as-template command is no longer available in OCP 4.1. What's the new way to export resources from a running project into a template?

With the removal of oc export --as-template I do not believe there is a replacement capability currently.

oc export is gone in general, the overall direction both oc and kubectl developers are guiding people to
use raw yaml/json and process the result as needed (iow. remove status or not, drop partial metadata or all, etc).
The main reason towards this is that the multiple possiblecombination how people have used the export results
and requested it being changed, sometimes even in completely separate directions.
One such conflicting example is  backup vs export for future reuse, where backup want all data (including status),
whereas the latter wants status and namespace cleared.
